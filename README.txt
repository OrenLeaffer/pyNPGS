This is a set of scripts developed for generating runfiles for NPGS from
DesignCad files saved in DC2 format. At this point they are embarrassingly
specific to my needs, but perhaps they will be useful to someone, hence the
sharing of something that is still half baked. 

If these turn out to be at all useful, I'd love to hear about it.

Copyrights for NPGS and DesignCad belong to their respective holders and
copyleft is asserted for these scripts under the GPL license.
